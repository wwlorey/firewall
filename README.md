# Programming assignment 7 (pa07) -- IPtables firewall script
Note: we're covering this material in depth early next week!
I'm releasing early so you can get a head start.

### Option 1
(Basic assignment):

Your task is to write a bash script which configures a firewall using IPtables.
In particular, it should be executed on the Debian VM to produce a lasting permanent change to the OS's firewall configuration (across reboots).
You should assume that the computer needs to be configured as a secure web server supporting incoming http and https traffic, with remote ssh access for you.
Further, you want ssh access limited to a particular static IP address (any will do).
Outgoing, the machine should be able to query the debian update server alone (besides stateful responses to web queries).
Connection tracking should be stateful in both directions, so that you are not leaving wide ranges of ports unnecessarily open, either outgoing in incoming.
Additionally, you should have secure defaults to reject all incoming and outgoing TCP and UDP traffic not necessary for the web server's above-stated functionality.
Considering the above, do you want someone to be able to browse from the web server? Do you need outgoing DNS open on the web server? How might you test with or without? 
The examples given in class contain valid firewall configuration options, but do not specify how to save or manage the configuration in a Debian-based operating system (Debian);
you will need to do some internet research to determine the correct way to save the configuration; we will have iptables.save installed.
You should test your firewall configuration script on the Debian VM, and validate that it behaves as you expect, by using Wireshark to test outgoing traffic and if you can, incoming connections, perhaps via nmap or other methods.
Submit one bash script, `fw_setup.sh`, with at least one full gramatically complete sentence comment above each configuration command describing what you are doing with EVERY line of of the configuration script; note: actually do this, we'll grade it.
You should assume that it will be run by a non-root user who has sudo priveledges.

Deliverable: `fw_setup.sh`

We will run something like this to check it:

```bash
bash fw_setup.sh  # to keep thes shell consistent
sudo iptables -S
sudo iptables -L
systemctl reboot
sudo iptables -S
sudo iptables -L
```


### Option 2
If you do this, you don't have to do Option 1.
For completing this option, you get a grade for pa07, and replace your lowest assignment with that same grade.
Complete both Part 1 and Part 2 below.


#### Part 1: 
Perform an in-depth code review and audit of the OpenSnitch firewall, which is a python frontend (go backend) that partly employs IPtables to manage traffic on a per-process basis, with a rule for each process ID (PID).
It is a "privacy firewall", which protects against applications connecting out to the internet without your permissions; these are helpful for security too.
This will be evaluated critically, graded individually, and must include a thorough technical documentation of the code-base, and demonstrate an understanding of the mechanisms of action of the projects whole code-base.
You should submit a written report and technical diagrams.
Your report should provide an easy-to-read documentation for the main operation of each project file and component.

OpenSnitch information:
* https://www.opensnitch.io/
* https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch/
* https://securityonline.info/opensnitch/

The following may help you in writing your code review and audit of opensnitch.
Some of these are more extensive than what you might produce for this assignment, and are just style examples.
I am looking for at least a full state diagram of the code, a functional description of the IPtables mechanism it uses to screet outgoing traffic by PID, and 3-4 pages of analysis.

Deliverable: `pa07-audit.pdf`


#### Part 2: 
You should try to tackle at least one of the outstanding GitHub issues (preferred), and if you can't find any reasonable issues to tackle, propose other code-related changes proposed to fix or improve the project (can be simple UI improvements if you can't find any security related issues).
If you feel this issue was solidly solved enough, then it may be helpful to create a merge request for the main project.
Note: this means you have to actually code the fix, and test your code change to the software, showing a before/after for your change.
Your improvement needs to be implemented and working.

Deliverable: `pa07-before_after.pdf` which details the changes you made, showing screenshots illustrating the impact of your improvment.
